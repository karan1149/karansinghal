      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure recently of working on Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2 with an extremely talented group of people. I wanted to jot some notes down here about the personal motivation that got me working in the medical setting, and why I think work in this direction could be important to ensuring AI is safe and beneficial.
Safety is highly, highly critical in this domain, both for shorter-term clinical workflows and longer-term progress towards increasingly general AI that can progress science.</description>
