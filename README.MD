# My homepage.

## Common workflows

### Development

Install Hugo first.

* `hugo server`
* Make changes.
* Stage and commit changes outside of docs/.
* `python3 publish.py`

### New content

* `hugo new notes/my-note.md`

### Customizing

* Edit `config.toml` to modify site-wide settings.
* Prefer to modify theme in `layouts` and avoid `themes` directory.

## Troubleshooting

* If the site isn't updating, try restarting `hugo server`.
* For Hugo-related issues, consult the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
